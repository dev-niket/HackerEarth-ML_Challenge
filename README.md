# HackerEarth-ML_Challenge

Author: Niket Ganatra (GitHub: https://github.com/dev-niket )

This repository contains my solutions to the problems of the HackerEarth ML Challenge which was held during June-July, 2020. I got a rank of 166 out of 5164 participants (worldwide) in the Machine Learning challenge on HackerEarth.

The challenge had 2 tasks, 2nd of which was to create a slightly detailed SQL query (not that difficult of a task). 30 points were allotted for this.

The main question which was for 100 marks was pertaining to Machine Learning. It was quite an extraordinary dataset, something that I personally had not come across before since the correlation between the output variable and the various input features was very low.
